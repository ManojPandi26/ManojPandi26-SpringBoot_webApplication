# TLCHotel Room Reservation System

  The Hotel Room Reservation System is a full-stack web application built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf that allows users to manage hotel room reservations. This application provides a convenient way for users to search for available rooms, make reservations, and view and cancel existing reservations through an intuitive user interface.


## Features

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts or log in using their credentials to access the reservation system.
- Room Reservation: Users can search for available rooms based on their preferred dates and criteria. They can specify the check-in and check-out dates, number of persons, and room type to find suitable accommodations.
- Reservation Management: Users can view their existing reservations and details such as check-in and check-out dates, total amount, and room information. They can also cancel reservations if their plans change.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


## FrontEnd
The frontend of the application is built using Thymeleaf, a template engine for server-side rendering of HTML pages. Thymeleaf allows for the dynamic generation of HTML content, enabling the display of dynamic data such as reservation details and room information.
## BackEnd
The backend of the application is developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework for building web applications. Spring Boot provides features such as dependency injection, auto-configuration, and web support, making it ideal for developing robust and scalable web applications. The backend handles user authentication, room reservation logic, database interactions, and other business logic.
## DataBase
The application uses MySQL as the relational database management system for storing user and reservation data. MySQL provides robust data storage and retrieval capabilities, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: Framework for building Java-based web applications, providing features such as dependency injection, auto-configuration, and web support.
- Thymeleaf: Template engine for generating dynamic HTML content, allowing server-side rendering of web pages with Java objects.
- MySQL: Relational database management system for storing user and reservation data, providing robust data storage and retrieval capabilities.
- Docker: Containerization platform for packaging and deploying the application, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.
